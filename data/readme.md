This folder contains all the datasets used in the paper. The BeamNG dataset is generated by our paper. Other datasets are publicly available and we provide links to their websites.

#  BeamNG Dataset

This dataset contains the BeamNG dataset used in the paper "Bridging the Gap between Real-world and Synthetic Images for Testing Autonomous Driving Systems". The dataset is used for the lane keeping task using the BeamNG ADS. `ds_beamng.csv` contains the paths to the images and the corresponding steering angles captured from the BeamNG simulator.
